# Cu Nanoparticles Dipole and Potential Analysis

This project analyzes the time evolution of **dipole moments** and **potential energy** for Cu, Au, and Pd nanoparticles.

The script reads simulation data from Excel files, plots dipole moment and potential energy versus time, and saves the resulting figures.

## Features

- Reads time-series data from Excel files  
- Plots dipole moments (left y-axis) and potential energy (right y-axis) on the same figure  
- Automatically scales axes for clarity  
- Saves figures in PNG format
